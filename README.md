# HDA-project

In the HDA_project/Colab Notebooks folder the reader can find the code generated for the Human Data Analytics Project, made of the two main jupyter notebooks along with the scripts containing useful functions.
The aim of the project was to find a new state-of-the-art approach for the bone-age prediction of patients with age between 1 and 19.
